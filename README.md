## Artist's Statement
In this book, I explore the evolution and energy of urban street art through visual compositions. Each spread uses different compositional techniques, creating a narrative that reflects the dynamic and rebellious spirit of street art. The covers provide an introduction and closure to the journey, encapsulating the essence of urban expression and creativity.


Thank you for exploring this project!
